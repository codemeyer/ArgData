# ArgData documentation 

This documentation uses [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo), which is a boilerplate for using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as your asset pipeline.

Use

```bash
npm install
```

This will take some time and will install all packages necessary to run Victor Hugo and its tasks.

While developing your website, use:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/argdata _- or a new browser windows popped-up already -_ to preview your new website. Webpack Dev Server will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

To build a static version of the website inside the `/dist` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
